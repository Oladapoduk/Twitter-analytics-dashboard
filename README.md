Creating a simple Twitter analytics dashboard
The @jumping_uk Twitter project accounted for the first half of my time at Jumping Rivers. The aim of the project was to look into some of the factors that may (or may not) have been affecting levels of engagement with @jumping_uk tweets. The project also looked at the locations of Twitter users that @jumping_uk tweets are reaching and who is interacting with them. The data used in this project was acquired using {rtweet}, an R package designed to collect data via Twitterâ€™s API.
